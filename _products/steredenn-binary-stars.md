**STEREDENN: BINARY&nbsp;STARS** is the hugely improved and massively expanded version of the [original **STEREDENN**](/products/steredenn/).

**STEREDENN: BINARY&nbsp;STARS** is an award-winning mashup of a classic _shmup_ and a _rogue-like_, carved in big beautiful pixels, with insane boss battles. Fly solo or co-op with a friend, fighting off the worst scourges of space in a never-ending struggle for survival.

More weapons, more upgrades, more polish, more waves, a new balance, a new scoring. Play with _5 different ships_, each with its own playstyle and special ability. Re-discover the game through the brand _new co-op mode_ and _the boss rush_. This expansion is the ultimate **STEREDENN** experience!

**STEREDENN: BINARY&nbsp;STARS** is available on _Steam_, _Nintendo Switch_, _Xbox One_, _PlayStation 4_ and _iOS_.
