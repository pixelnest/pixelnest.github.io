**presskit.html** is a tool to create a presskit for your company, products or games.

The goal of **presskit.html** is to generate only static HTML pages â€” no PHP required at all. Just fill some XML data files, add some images, execute a command, and boom. It's done.

This is a complete re-implementation, with a permissive MIT license, of [presskit()][dopresskit], which was originally created by [Rami Ismail](https://twitter.com/tha_rami) of [Vlambeer](http://www.vlambeer.com).

To quote the original [presskit()][dopresskit]:

> Developers & press both have the same goal: to bring great games to as many people as possible - after all, a good game is worth nothing if no-one plays it. For the press, finding out about a game but not having access to information & media for the game means that they can't write about it. Of course, developers want to spend their valuable time making games instead of press pages.

> **presskit()** (pronounced _'do presskit'_) is the solution. Free for everyone, open and easy-to-use for both developers & press. Developers only have to spend an hour or so creating well-laid out press pages with everything the press needs to write to their hearts desire. Everybody wins.

It uses an _almost-identical format and output_ as its precursor. The goal is to be compatible, as much as possible.

And even if [presskit()][dopresskit] was conceived with videogames in mind, we think that you can use it for any kind of product.
