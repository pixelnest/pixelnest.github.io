_RAMPAINT_ is a multiplayer-platformer-fighter game for your couch, friends and TV.

**This project has been discontinued on 13 aug. 2014. See [this Journal post](/2014/08/pixelnest-overview/) to know why.**

It involves explosions, powershards and giant avatars.

Remember the unforgettable nights playing [Smash Bros](http://www.smashbros.com/) with your friends? We aim to create something this good.
