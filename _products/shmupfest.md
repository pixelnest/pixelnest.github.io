The **Shmupfest** is a game we made for the [Stunfest 2014][stunfest], a french video game festival based in Rennes.

It's an **infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up**, created with Unity. Bullets patterns are designed and implemented with our own library, _[BulletML for Unity][bulletml]_.

All the [sprites][shmupfest] have been drawn by the [Ulule's backers][ulule], making the game _truly unique_ and _personalized_ for the festival.

**Tasks**: Unity3D and C# development. Game design. Web design and development. Marketing.
