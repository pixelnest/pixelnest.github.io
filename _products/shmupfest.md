The **Shmupfest** is a game we made for the [Stunfest 2014][stunfest], a french video game festival based in Rennes.

**[Play the game!][play]**

It's an _infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up_, created with Unity. Bullets patterns are designed and implemented with _[BulletML for Unity][bulletml]_.

All the [sprites][shmupfest] have been drawn by the [Ulule's backers][ulule], making the game truly unique and personalized for the festival.

The game will be playable during (in-place) and after the festival.
