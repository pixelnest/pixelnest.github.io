*BulletML for Unity* is a **simple** and **powerful** wrapper around [BulletML](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/bulletml/index_e.html) (originally created by Kenta Cho), for Unity 4.3 or higher, made by [Pixelnest Studio](https://pixelnest.io).

It allows you to design some very complex bullet patterns with a simple XML file. It’s especially useful in “Shoot’Em Up” (_shmup_) games to create memorable boss fights or enemies.

<div data-block="info">
  **Game**: although _BulletML for Unity_ is intended to be used in shmups, it is NOT limited to this genre. _You can use it in any game you want_.
</div>
