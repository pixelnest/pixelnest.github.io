## Game development
{: .skill-gd }

We have designed and released a few games, most notably [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io). We are mostly efficient doing 2D games, with an heavy focus on the feeling and "juiciness". We use **Unity3D** and **C#**, but we might do some small games on a web browser with Javascript.

## Web

We can handle your front-end work, using HTML/CSS and Javascript. We can create custom back-ends with [Go](https://golang.org/) and [C#/ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/).

## Design

We can design your user interface, for a web site, a game or an application. We use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) only. _We can help you design a great user experience for your product._
