The **Shmupfest** is a game we made for the [Stunfest 2014][stunfest], a french video game festival based in Rennes.

It's an **infinite retro 2D Shoot'Em Up**, made with Unity. Bullets patterns are made with [BulletML][bulletml].

All the sprites have been made by the [Ulule's backers][ulule], making the game unique and personalized.
