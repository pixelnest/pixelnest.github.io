In addition to Unity 4.3 or superior, the plugin requires two extra libraries bundled in the package (/Plugins folder):

* **BulletMLLib.dll**: a modified C# BulletML implementation (parser and engine) based on the open-source one. We mainly updated the lib to use Unity framework.
* **Equationator.dll**: an [open-source library](https://github.com/dmanning23/Equationator) to compute an equation from a string
