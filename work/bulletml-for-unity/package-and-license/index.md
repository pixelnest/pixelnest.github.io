_BulletML for Unity_ is available for **20$** (normal price), only on the Unity Asset Store. It's:

* One license per developer.
* Full documentation, code and demos.
* An extensive list of patterns for BulletML.

Unfortunately, _you cannot ask for a refund_. By buying this product, you gain full access to the source code and examples and we cannot take it back. _Think about it a second before proceeding._

20$ is just the price of a few hours of work. We think that our plugin will save you much more time than that. ;)

# Disclaimer

This plugin is NOT the BulletML library (but it includes it).

It's a wrapper around it to make it work on Unity effortlessly. We are not the provider and main developer behind the official library.
