*BulletML for Unity* is a **simple** and **powerful** wrapper around BulletML, for Unity 4.3 and above made by [Pixelnest Studio](http://pixelnest.io).

[ ![Screenshot][screenshot] ][screenshot]

It allows you to design some very complex shmup patterns in a simple XML file.

# Main features

- Simple and lightweight. No scripting required (if you don't want to).
- Bullet bank mechanism. Associate a pattern's bullet to a sprite easily.
- Customizable.
- Multiplatform.

Have a look at our [plugin demo][demo] to see what is possible (hint: a lot). This plugin works on all the platforms Unity supports.
