*BulletML for Unity* is a **simple** and **powerful** wrapper around BulletML, for Unity 4.3 or higher, made by [Pixelnest Studio](http://pixelnest.io).

[ ![Screenshot1][screenshot1] ][screenshot1]

It allows you to design some very complex bullet patterns with a simple XML file. It’s especially useful in “Shoot’Em Up” (_shmup_) games to create memorable boss fights or enemies.

<md-info>
_Game_: Although _BulletML for Unity_ is intended to be used in shmups, it is NOT limited to this genre. _You can use it in any game you want_.
