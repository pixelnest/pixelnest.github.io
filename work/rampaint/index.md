RAMPAINT is a multiplayer-platformer-fighter game for your couch, friends and TV.

It involves explosions, powershards and giant avatars.

Remember the unforgettable nights playing [Smash Bros](http://www.smashbros.com/) with your friends? We aim to create something this good.

It is currently _in development_ (and far from complete) and should be released during the year 2014. When it's done.
