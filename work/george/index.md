“_George_ was an unknown salary man, working in the offices of the CaribbeanMegaBank™ (also known as the CMB). But one day, he got bored and decided to live a real pirate adventure!

So he bought a small boat and sailed away, looking for lost treasures on islands.

His goal? Find as many treasures as possible the day and come back home before the night. But on the way back, the more gold he amasses the more he will encounter jealous pirates!”

_George_ was a short game made for the Stunfest 2013 (an event at Rennes, France) in collaboration with [Marion Chrétien](http://marion-chretien.fr/).

It was developed for the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) controller.
