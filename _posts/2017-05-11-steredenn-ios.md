# The road to the App Store

What a journey!

When we started the development of Steredenn during the spring of 2014, we originally planned to launch the game on mobile a few months later. We were so young and naiveâ€¦ ;)

In the end, we took one year and a half to complete the game, and we released Steredenn on Steam (PC/Mac/Linux). We then changed our focus to the consoles, with a release on Xbox One and PS4 later.

But secretly, we still wanted to port the game on mobile devicesâ€¦ and the first step is complete today! [Get the game on the App Store for iPhone and iPad now.][app-store]

# But what about Android?

For Android users: we know that you also want to play the game, and we don't forget you. But, alas, we have limited bandwith (we are only two people) and we can't test and polish the game enough at the moment. We are still working on it, and we **do** want to release it on Android.

We don't have a release date yet, neither an estimation of the time we will need, [so stay tuned](https://twitter.com/pixelnest/). ;)
