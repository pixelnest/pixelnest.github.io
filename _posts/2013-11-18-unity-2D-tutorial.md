Fellow game developers,

You probably heard last week that Unity has released along with the 4.3 version a new set of [great 2D tools](http://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-4.3).

If you haven't tried Unity yet, we think that it is the best time to give it a shot.

And this is why we have written a tutorial showing you a complete development cycle of a "Shoot'Em Up" game, from the editor installation to the deployment on your mobile device:

[See the tutorial: Create a 2D game with Unity](https://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/)

We hope you will enjoy the reading. Feel free [to contact us](https://pixelnest.io/contact/) for any additional question or feedback.

And for our french readers: the translation is nearly finished! Sorry for the delay, we are working hard on it.
