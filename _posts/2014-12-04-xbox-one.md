Hey folks,

Last week, Damien and I were at the [EIGD](http://www.eigd.org/en) and [TGS](http://www.toulouse-game-show.fr/).

We made a big announcement during our Pitch My Game presentation: _[Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io) is coming on the Xbox One!_ \o/

[_(You can find our presentation here.)_](https://speakerdeck.com/solarsailer/pixelnest-steredenn-pmg-eigd-2014)

We talked with a lot of awesome people during the week-end. We also had a demo of Steredenn which was played by hundreds of gamers. 

We got tons of feedback. We cannot thank you enough for your support, your time and the love you showed for Steredenn. :)

_It's going to be awesome._

A special mention to a few games we (re-)discovered during the week:

* [NeuroVoider](http://www.flying-oak.com/works/neurovoider/), a beautiful upcoming twin-stick shooter;
* [Lavapools](http://lavapools.com/), a deadly hardcore-arcade-dodge-surviveifyoucan game (currently on sale); 
* [Kaaarot](http://www.kaaarot.com/), a fun multiplayers smasher; 
* And the splendid [Ilios](http://www.ilios-thegame.com/ilios/) we already saw during the Stunfest 2014.
