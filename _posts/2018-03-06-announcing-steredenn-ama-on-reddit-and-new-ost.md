## OST on Bandcamp

Finally, the new OST is out! You can listen to it on [Bandcamp][sbsost] right now.

It's still the awesome work from the fabulous [Zander Noriega][zander], the original compositor behind the [Steredenn soundtrack][sost].

This version includes all the original tracks, as well as 3 new tracks for Binary Stars version:

1. [Binary Stars](https://zandernoriega.bandcamp.com/track/binary-stars)
2. [Dimensionless Devourers](https://zandernoriega.bandcamp.com/track/dimensionless-devourers)
3. [Theorem 199 (Supermassive)](https://zandernoriega.bandcamp.com/track/theorem-199-supermassive)
4. [And a bonusâ€¦](https://zandernoriega.bandcamp.com/track/ghosts-of-steredennia-b-side)

**Theorem 199 (Supermassive)** is a reprise of an old track of Zander Noriega (Theorem 199), that we used for an early teaser of the game. We loved it so much that we asked him to rework it a bit for the new version.

You can listen for free on Bandcamp, or buy it for a cheap $3. Anyways, it's a steal! Enjoy. ðŸ˜‰


<br><br>A small reminder: you can already [pre-purchase the game on the Nintendo Switch eShop page][eshop] right now!
