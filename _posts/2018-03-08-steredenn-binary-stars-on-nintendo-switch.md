It's here. **Steredenn: Binary Stars** is _out now_ on Nintendo Switch!

For us, it's a brand new platform, as well as the first release of our huge expansion for Steredenn, featuring local co-op mode, 5 playable ships, a new mode, and **tons** of new content.

Buy it here: [https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/steredenn-binary-stars-switch][eshop]

You can watch the brand new trailer:

And don't forget the AMA we are doing today on [/r/NintendoSwitch][subreddit] (at 08:00 AM PST/05:00 PM CET). Ask us anything!

Share the love and speak about the game: everything helps spreading the word about Steredenn â€” this means a lot to us. We want to share this last year of intensive work to as many people as we can.

**Thanks for your patience. We hope you'll love Steredenn: Binary Stars.**
