Happy new year!

Let's start with a great new for Pixelnest: _Steredenn has been submitted on Steam Greenlight!_

[![Steredenn on Greenlight][greenlight_avatar]][greenlight_avatar]

Our main focus is still the Xbox One, but we don't want to forget PC players.

If you like Steredenn — we sure hope so —, [help us getting greenlit](http://steredenn-greenlight.pixelnest.io/)!
