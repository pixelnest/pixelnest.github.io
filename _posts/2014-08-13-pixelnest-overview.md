Two days ago, we made a big announcement in the form of [_Steredenn_](/2014/08/steredenn/).

Rest assured, _Steredenn is our main focus for now and until its release_. We are not working on anything else, as we did before by working on a few things at the same time.

But… What happened to our other projects?

- _BulletML for Unity_ is one of the core components of Steredenn. We are using and updating it.
- _Rampaint_ is currently in pause. We are not working on it for the moment, and we may ditch it completely in the future. It was a cool project, but we aren't sure to where it might lead us.
- The _Shmupfest_ is complete. We will not update the game anymore, but you can [play it online](https://pixelnest.io/shmupfest/play).

One last word about the tutorials: because we want to invest 100% of our time into Steredenn, we are not going to write tutorials anytime soon. However, we will document [the process of creating Steredenn on its devblog](http://steredenn-game.tumblr.com). If you want to learn a bit more about the creation of a game, be sure to subscribe to this tumblr. ;)

And that's all for today!
