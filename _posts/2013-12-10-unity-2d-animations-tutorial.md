Fellow game developers, many of you asked us when we were going to release a new chapter about the 2D animations tools with Unity 4.3.

The answer is... now!

We are very happy to announce that the topic is now covered in depth in the tutorial! We made two parts, as there is a lot to show and explain.

[See the updated table of content.](https://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/table-of-contents/)

You will learn how to make an end-level boss that uses animations. You can see the result below:
