STEREDENN is a new blend of a typical shoot'em up and an infinite hardcore roguelike.

The game is an endless aventure. It's unforgiving. It's hard. Weapons are numerous and each has a distinct playstyle. Levels are randomly generated, with a lot of different and completely unpredictable events (asteroid fields, laser rains, meteor showers, old battlefields, labyrinths of lasers, etc.). Boss fights are tough, intense and epic. Each time one of them is defeated, the ship can be upgraded — unlocking new powers and abilities.

The game offers around twenty beautiful pixel-art backgrounds, a dozen of terrific and gigantic bosses, tons of upgrades and weapons and hundreds of hand-made enemy waves.

The game has been awarded the prestigious title of "Best Shoot'em Up of the year 2015 on PC" by the well-known french website jeuxvideo.com. It received 90% of positive reviews on Steam, and an average score of 85% in many magazines and websites.

_STEREDENN is fast, hard, addictive and action-packed._
