Hello folks,

I'm not sure anyone will ever read this post (probably Matthieu with an RSS reader 😁).

But still, it's important to write it.

Pixelnest is coming back!

I (Damien) am getting 100% of the studio, thanks to Matthieu who will continue his own adventures.

I'll be joined by my favorite 3D magician [Eddy Margueron](https://skia.artstation.com/) and together we're working on... a new game!

In the arcade DNA of our previous games (Steredenn, Flipon) we're revealing CTHULOOT: an arcade coop game  for PC and consoles.

There'll be more announcements to come so be sure to:

- Wishlist the [Steam page of the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2283410/Chtuloot/)
- Follow us on Twitter/X: [@pixelnest](https://twitter.com/pixelnest) or [@cthuloot](https://twitter.com/cthuloot)

Stay tuned! 💎🐙
