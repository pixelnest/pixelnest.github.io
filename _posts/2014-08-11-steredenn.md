It has been a long time since we've made a public announcement. _We were hard at work on a very cool new thing._

It's time for us to reveal our new baby: _Steredenn_! And there's no better way to present it than with this short teaser we've made for you:

Steredenn is a frenetic space shooter, carved in big beautiful pixels. But enough talking, just go read what's on [the brand new Steredenn's website](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io/). ;)

The game is made in collaboration with this awesome illustrator and friend of ours: [Plus](http://pluspixels.tumblr.com/).

_We are thrilled to present this new game_. It's coming really soon and we will post a lot of updates on our [twitter](https://twitter.com/pixelnest), the [game devblog](http://steredenn-game.tumblr.com) and the [newsletter](http://pixelnest.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=cb1093a5798d3677ea320108b&id=55e71ae780).

We've also updated our press kit. [It's available here](https://pixelnest.io/presskit).

Have fun awaiting Steredenn.
