We are going to the [EGX Rezzed](http://www.egx.net/rezzed) (12-14 March, 2015) in London!

[ ![EGX][egx] ][EGX]

*The game will be (almost-)fully playable.* Come and try to get the best score!

<br>

As of today, Steredenn is also [available on pre-order](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io/#humble-widget) for Steam (PC/Mac/Linux). *As soon as the beta is ready, we will give an access to all the buyers.* What's best? The game is also *on sale* for a limited time and *only for the pre-orders*.

Pre-ordering the game is the best way to support us! :)

Thanks.
