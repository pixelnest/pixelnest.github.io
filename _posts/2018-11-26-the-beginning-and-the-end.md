After 5 years of Pixelnest Studio, we — [Matthieu](https://matthieuoger.com/) & [Damien](https://dmayance.com/) — are moving onto new adventures, starting January 2019.

**This is not a breakup!** Everything is great but after doing the same job for the past 5 years, we want to explore new and different topics, jobs and positions. Steredenn was a **huge critical and commercial success** (for us at least) and we’re so grateful that we’ve been able to this for the last years.

We’re deeply thankful for all the people we met and all the players we had.

And we secretly hope that Steredenn will continue to be played in the next fifty years. 💪

Some notes:

1. **Steredenn: Binary Stars is coming to iOS on Jan. 2019.**
2. We are still supporting Steredenn (i.e. fixing bugs - a patch is coming, btw).
3. We have a final surprise later in 2019.

We are keeping the company alive for at least one or two years. Feel free to contact us if you have any request or question regarding our services or our games. _But Pixelnest Studio will not be our main activity anymore_, so don't expect a quick answer. 😉

* [Matthieu](https://matthieuoger.com/) is looking for a **Product Manager** job in Paris (or Amsterdam). [LinkedIn resume here](https://linkedin.com/in/matthieuoger/).
* [Damien](https://dmayance.com/) will continue being a **freelance game developer**. [LinkedIn resume here](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/damienmayance).

Thanks everyone, it was a fantastic ride for both of us! 🙏
