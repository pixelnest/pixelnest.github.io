To recap quickly what **Steredenn: Binary Stars** is:

- Local co-op;
- New playable ships;
- Boss rush;
- [Tons of new content (music, bosses, waves, weapons, upgrades)][changelog].

[Youn can read the FAQ about our thought-process and decisions behind the update for more information.][faq]

## Steam

It's bundled as a free DLC, automatically included with your **Steredenn** purchase. Restart Steam, and you should see a new update available. You'll get the [2.0.0][u200], [2.1.0][u210] and [2.1.1][u211] updates in one package.

The leaderboards are also new. You can still check the old ones, but **Steredenn: Binary Stars** is a fresh start for everyone.

You can switch between **Steredenn: Classic** and **Steredenn: Binary Stars** at will, just by clicking the checkbox in the DLC list.

Obviously, there isn't many reasons to play **Steredenn: Classic** instead of **Steredenn: Binary Stars**, but if you are nostalgic, it's still possible. ;)

## Xbox One

The update should be available in a few hours. The game will be automatically updated as soon as the update is live. You'll get the same updates as the Steam version, meaning the [2.0.0][u200], [2.1.0][u210] and [2.1.1][u211].
