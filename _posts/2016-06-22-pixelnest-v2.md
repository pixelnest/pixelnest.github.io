Hello!

After a few months in the work, **we are happy to announce the new face of Pixelnest!**

For the occasion, we revamped the whole website as well. If you find any problem in your browser or any dead link, please tell us. ;)

Our old identity wasn't representative of us anymore. The pirate (George) meant nothing to many of our followers, and the website seriously started to feel dated. It was time to do something. And now that most of the work on [Steredenn](https://pixelnest.io/products/steredenn/) is over, we could really take the time to reimagine ourselves for the years to come.

I will probably write something about the process behind the redesign, but now is not the day.

If you are wondering what is the meaning of the logo… well, it's open to interpretation. I personally see a mask, but some think it's a cat, while Damien thinks it's a fox. It's up to you!

Thanks to you for allowing us to continue Pixelnest, almost two years after its debut. **Be ready for the launch of Steredenn on PS4 in a few days!**
