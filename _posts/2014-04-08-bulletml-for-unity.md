Hello,

Our first package for Unity—_BulletML for Unity_—has been accepted! Great! But… what is _BulletML for Unity_?

From our [documentation][bulletml]:

> _BulletML for Unity_ is a **simple and powerful wrapper around BulletML**, for Unity 4.3 or higher.

> It allows you to design some very complex bullet patterns with a simple XML file. It’s especially useful in _“Shoot’Em Up”_ (shmup) games to create memorable boss fights or enemies.

> Although BulletML for Unity is intended to be used in _shmups_, it is NOT limited to this genre. _You can use it in any game you want._

The plugin costs 20$ on the Asset Store.

You can find more information about the features, the package and the [license][bulletml_license] on our [complete documentation][bulletml].
