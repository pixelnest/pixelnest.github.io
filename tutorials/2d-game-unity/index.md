Using the **Unity** native 2D tools, you will learn how to make a small "Shoot'Em Up" (abbreviated to _shmup_ thereafter) with this tutorial.

The result will be a lot like this demo:

_(Click on the image to play)_

With time and work you can make a game like [Steredenn][steredenn]. We actually use the code of the tutorial in our game!

We will focus on a _shmup_ with an horizontal scrolling. However, if this tutorial does its job correctly, you'll understand how to extend the code to many other genres.

The assets, gameplay and original idea come from the game [The Great Paper Adventure][tgpa_link]. Damien created this game a few years ago using [XNA][xna_link]. When we started this tutorial, we thought it was a perfect material to explain Unity.

# Unity

[Unity3D][unity_link] is a popular and complete solution to create multiplatform video games. This tutorial assumes that you are _at least a bit familiar_ with a programming language. Knowing the tools and the engine is a _plus_, but is not necessary.

This tutorial is made with the Unity 5 **Personal Edition** (free) version.

# Video version

If you'd rather **watch** this tutorial than **read** it, then have a look at [Jay Jennings's work from Game Dev Nation](http://gamedevnation.com/creating-a-2d-game-with-unity/).
