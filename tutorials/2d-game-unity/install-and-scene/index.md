In this first chapter you will find some very basic informations: first, the download and installation of Unity, then the preparation of the first scene of our game.

# Set up your environment

We start by the easy part: downloading and configuring Unity.

[ ![Unity][unity_logo_url] ][unity_logo_url]

## Install Unity

Download the latest release from the [official website][unity_download_link].

Launch the executable and everything will be properly install.

## Choose a code editor

Unity is bundled with MonoDevelop (4.0.1 as of today) to edit code.

### Windows

If you are on Windows you can (and should) use an alternative:

* [Visual Studio 2013 Desktop (C#)][vs_download_link] for Windows

Likewise: download and install, it's simple as everything is bundled, though it might take a little time. Then, in the Unity preferences, change your default editor to Visual Studio.

[ ![Change the preferences][unity_prefs_vs_url] ][unity_prefs_vs_url]

<md-warning>
_Good to know_: It's not possible to use the Visual Studio 2013 Express debugger with Unity. You need to have a _Pro_ version of Visual Studio AND to buy the plugin [UnityVS][unityvs_link]. With the Express version, you will have a better code editor, but the lack of a debugger may be critical.
</md-warning>

### Mac OS X

[MonoDevelop 4][md_link] is very similar to [Xamarin Studio][xs_link]. Which means that it is way better than the old MonoDevelop 2 of the previous releases of Unity. It is far from perfect, but if you are on a Mac, it's still the best option that you've got.

### Which language ?

Unity allows you to code in three languages : JavaScript (UnityScript), C# and Boo.

We highly recommend that you use C#. It's more powerful and less error-prone. Moreover, this tutorial is written in C#.

## What if I am a total Unity newbie?

If you are totally new to Unity, we will do our best to explain it as much as we can in this tutorial.

Learning to use the main interface of Unity is relatively easy. _You might be scared the first time you open the software_, but it is just a matter of hours to be comfortable with it.

Here are some other resources that we find interesting and that should complete us on this subject:

- [Official Unity editor tutorials][unity_videos_link]: The official videos are great. You should take an afternoon to watch them all â€” we guarantee you that you will not lose your time.

- [Unity Patterns][unitypatterns_link]: A fresh new site with great articles and tools. The tutorials about coroutines is a must-read if you are not familiar with the concept.

# The first scene

## Create a new project

Go to file, then create a new project. Do not check any standard package for now. You can re-import them later if you want, but at first it will just confuse you.

[ ![Create a new Unity project][unity_create_project] ][unity_create_project]

Select the **2D** settings. Like before, you can change this flag in the project settings later.

_Do not worry about the name_. The product name is defined in the options and changing the whole project name only consists in renaming the folder.

## Prepare the project

As Damien explained in [another tutorial][dam_versionning_tutorial], if you plan to use Git or SVN, the first thing you need to do is to enable some obscure settings for team collaboration.

Instead of writing what he have already written before, just check the [tutorial][dam_versionning_tutorial] if you are interested. :)

## Unity layout and panels

You now face a nice empty scene. Here is the layout we are using, but you should take some times to personalize the interface to your needs. I (Damien) personally like to have the console next to the game view, but if you have a small screen you may use tabs instead of panels.

[ ![An empty project][unity_empty_project] ][unity_empty_project]

Before jumping into the game creation, take a few minutes to organize your project and scenes.

We advise to create folders in the Unity "Project" pane to organize your stuffs. These folders will technically be created in the _Assets_ folder  of your project.

<md-note>
_Note_: The "Assets" folder is the superfolder containing everything you add in the "Project" pane. It _may_ not be visible inside Unity, depending on the selected layout for the pane (One-column or Two-columns), but if you open your file explorer, you will be able to see it.
</md-note>

[ ![Folders][unity_folders] ][unity_folders]

Here is an example of a structure we use for our projects at Pixelnest. You can adapt it to fit your preferences.

## Project assets

In your "Project" pane, you can find different types of assets:

### Prefabs

Reusable game objects (ex: Bullets, enemies, bonuses).

Prefabs can be seen as a ``class`` in a programming language, which can be instantiated into game objects. It's a mold you can duplicate and change at will in the scene or during the game execution.

### Scenes

A scene is basically a level or a menu.

Contrary to the other objects you create in the "Project" pane, scenes are created with the "File" menu. If you want to create a scene, click on the "New Scene" submenu, then do not forget to save it to the "Scenes" folder.

Scenes need to be manually saved. It's a classic mistake in Unity to make some changes to a scene and its elements and to forget to save it after. Your version control tool will not see any change until you scene is saved.

### Sounds

I guess it's pretty clear. See if you want to split musics in another folder.

### Scripts

All the code goes here. We use this folder as the equivalent of a root folder in a C# project.

### Textures

Textures are sprites and images of your game. In a 2D project, you could rename this folder to "Sprites".

It doesn't really matter in a 2D project, but by keeping the name "Textures", Unity will recognize it and automate some tasks. If you want some informations about this topic, you can read [this](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/172384/importing-models.html) or [this](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Components/class-Mesh.html).

<br />
<md-note>
_Note about the "Resources" folder_: If you have already tried Unity before, you may know that "Resources" is a useful and unique folder. It allows you to load an object or a file inside a script (using the static `Resources` class). <br />We will not be using it until... nearly the end (in the chapter about menus). So, to simplify, we decided to not include it for now.
</md-note>

## Our first game scene

The "Hierarchy" pane contains every object that is available in the scene. This is what you manipulate when you start the game with the "Play" button.

Each object of the scene is a "game object" for Unity. You can create an object on the root of the scene, or as a child of another game object. You can move an object at any time to change its parent.

[ ![Logicial objects][unity_logical_objects] ][unity_logical_objects]

As you can see here, we have 3 children for the ``Level`` object.

### Empty objects

A trick in Unity is to create an empty game object and use it as a "folder" for other game objects. It will simplify your scene hierarchy.

[ ![Empty objects][unity_create_empty] ][unity_create_empty]

**Make sure they all are at the ``(0, 0, 0)`` position so you can track them easily! The position is not important as these empty objects are not using it.**

<md-note>
_Note_: Changing the position will affect the children relative position. We will not speak about this topic in this tutorial, so let the position of the empty objects to ``(0, 0, 0)`` for the moment.
</md-note>

See those empty objects as purely logical ones.

### Filling the scene

By default, a new scene is created with a default ``Main Camera``. Keep it.

For the moment, you will need to create these empty objects :

- ``Scripts``: We will add our global scripts here. We use this object to attach the scripts that are not related to an object. For example, we will have a "Game" manager script attached to it.
- ``Render``: Move the camera here. We also put the lights objects inside this one.
- ``Level``

In the ``Level`` object, add three empty children :

- ``0 - Background``
- ``1 - Middleground``
- ``2 - Foreground``

Save the scene in the "Scenes" folder. Call it how you want (what about "Stage1"?).

You should have:

[ ![Your first scene][unity_first_scene] ][unity_first_scene]

<md-tip>
_Tip_: By default, a game object is bounded to its parent position. <br /><br />This behavior creates a nice side-effect for a camera game object: if a camera is the child of an object, it will track its parent position automatically. If the camera is at the root of the scene or inside an empty game object, the view is fixed. However, if you put the camera inside a moving game object, the camera will follow this object on the scene. <br /><br />Nonetheless, for our game, we want to keep the camera fixed and this is why we put it inside a `Render` empty game object. But remember this property of a camera object, it can be handy. <br />We will cover this topic a bit longer in the "Parallax Scrolling" chapter.
</md-tip>

# Next step

We are still far from a game, right?

We have just created the basic structure of our game. In the next step we will start to add fun things: a background and some elements!
